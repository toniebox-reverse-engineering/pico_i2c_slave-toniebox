# I2C MMA8451Q emulator for the Toniebox
This implementents a rudimentary emulation for the acceleration sensor of the Toniebox to replace it with buttons. It is tested with the CC3200 Variant. The CC3235 may work. The ESP32 based box has a different acceleration sensor and is not supported!
Using GP10 and GP11 is recommended, as it combines all functions in two buttons.

## ATTENTION - THIS WILL VOID YOU WARRANTY
I did this mod without deep electrical knowledge. The voltage regulator should be able to handle the extra as the DAC is also connected to it. If there is anything bad, please let me know. If this breaks your box, don't blame me or Tonies!

## Known side effects
As I cannot cut the power of the pico, it need around 1mA when the box is off. When the box is running 30-50mAs extra.

## Cut the VDD of the MMA8451Q
Please cut the VDD of the MMA8451Q (blue) marked with the red line.
Just use a sharp knife and do the cut as the line suggest. Afterwards check if the vias above the line and the capacitor below are not connected anymore.

Hint: If you want to remove this mod, you'll just need resolder this connection and the MMA8451Q works again.

### Optional (buttons)
| Pico | Function |
| --- | --- |
| GP06 | Tap right |
| GP07 | Tap left |

| GP09 | Tilt right |
| GP10 | Short = tap right, hold = tilt left |
| GP11 | Short = tap left, hold = tilt right |
| GP10+11 | Hold both = box is headsdown |
| BOOTSEL | Short = tap left, hold = box is headsdown |


## Compiling manually - Setup

Follow the instructions in [Getting started with Raspberry Pi Pico](https://datasheets.raspberrypi.org/pico/getting-started-with-pico.pdf) to setup your build environment. You'll also need pico-extras!
Then:

- `git clone https://github.com/toniebox-reverse-engineering/pico_i2c_slave-toniebox`
- `cd pico_i2c_slave-toniebox`
- `mkdir build`, `cd build`, `cmake ../`, `make`
- copy `example_mem/example_mem.uf2` to Raspberry Pico
- open a serial connection and check output
